Japan's crypto regulations are among the strictest in the world. Manual compliance checking? Slow. Error-prone. Expensive. Traditional tools? They fail to keep up with Solana's speed. But what if an AI agent could audit tokens in real-time?

In Japan, crypto exchanges must follow strict PSA regulations. Every token needs vetting. Compliance teams manually check token holder distribution, centralization risks, securities classification, and licensing requirements. This takes hours per token. And mistakes can cost millions in fines.

Introducing Solana Compliance Guardian. An autonomous AI agent that audits Solana tokens in seconds. It combines real-time blockchain analysis with expert compliance rules built on the Torii platform. Let me show you how it works.

Let's audit a real Solana token. I'll use BONK, one of the most popular meme coins. Just paste the mint address, select Japan as the jurisdiction, and hit Audit.

The agent immediately springs into action. First, it fetches on-chain data from Solana: token metadata, holder distribution, and transaction history. Then, it analyzes this data against Japan's Payment Services Act regulations. All of this happens autonomously. No human intervention needed.

And there we have it. A complete compliance report in under 30 seconds. The risk score is 55 out of 100, Medium Risk. The agent identified several compliance flags. High holder concentration, the top wallet owns 35 percent of supply. Centralized upgrade authority, a single wallet controls updates. But here's where it gets smart. The agent doesn't just flag problems. It provides actionable recommendations. Implement multi-signature governance. Encourage wider token distribution. Consider JFSA registration if offering to Japanese users. Each violation links directly to the relevant Japanese regulation.

Traditional compliance checks take hours and require legal experts. Solana Compliance Guardian does it in seconds, autonomously. It's the only hackathon project combining Solana-native blockchain analysis with Japan's crypto regulations. Built entirely by AI agents during this hackathon. Every line of code. Every integration. Autonomous.

Want to try it yourself? The full code is open source on GitHub. Built with Solana Web3.js, Torii compliance engine, and Next.js. This is the future of regulatory technology in crypto. Fast. Autonomous. Solana-native. Solana Compliance Guardian. Making compliance simple.
