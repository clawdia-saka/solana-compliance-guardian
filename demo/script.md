## 🎬 OPENING (0:00-0:20)

**[Visual: Dark screen with text overlay]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Japan's crypto regulations are among the strictest in the world. 
> 
> Manual compliance checking? Slow. Error-prone. Expensive.
> 
> Traditional tools? They fail to keep up with Solana's speed.
>
> But what if an AI agent could audit tokens in real-time?"

**[Visual: Logo reveal - "SOLANA COMPLIANCE GUARDIAN"]**

## 🔴 PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:20-0:45)

**[Visual: Screen recording - news articles about crypto regulations, compliance fines]**

**Voiceover:**
> "In Japan, crypto exchanges must follow strict PSA regulations. Every token needs vetting.
>
> Compliance teams manually check:
> - Token holder distribution
> - Centralization risks  
> - Securities classification
> - Licensing requirements
>
> This takes hours per token. And mistakes can cost millions in fines."

**[Visual: Show example of manual spreadsheet compliance checking - looks tedious]**

## ✅ SOLUTION (0:45-1:00)

**[Visual: Dashboard homepage with clean UI]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Introducing Solana Compliance Guardian.
>
> An autonomous AI agent that audits Solana tokens in seconds.
>
> It combines real-time blockchain analysis with expert compliance rules built on the Torii platform.
>
> Let me show you how it works."

## 🎯 DEMO FLOW (1:00-2:15)

### Step 1: Token Input (1:00-1:15)

**[Visual: Screen recording - typing into audit form]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Let's audit a real Solana token. I'll use BONK - one of the most popular meme coins.
>
> Just paste the mint address, select Japan as the jurisdiction, and hit Audit."

- Select: "Japan" from dropdown
- Check boxes: ICO, KYC/AML, Licensing
- Click "Submit Audit" button]**

---

### Step 2: Agent Processing (1:15-1:35)

**[Visual: Loading screen with live progress indicators]**

**Voiceover:**
> "The agent immediately springs into action.
>
> First, it fetches on-chain data from Solana - token metadata, holder distribution, and transaction history.
>
> Then, it analyzes this data against Japan's Payment Services Act regulations.
>
> All of this happens autonomously. No human intervention needed."

**[Visual: Show progress indicators:
- ✅ Fetching token metadata...
- ✅ Analyzing holder distribution...
- ✅ Checking compliance rules...
- ✅ Generating report...]**

### Step 3: Results Display (1:35-2:10)

**[Visual: Audit results page]**

**Voiceover:**
> "And there we have it. A complete compliance report in under 30 seconds.
>
> The risk score is 55 out of 100 - Medium Risk.
>
> The agent identified several compliance flags:
> - High holder concentration - the top wallet owns 35% of supply
> - Centralized upgrade authority - a single wallet controls updates
>
> But here's where it gets smart. The agent doesn't just flag problems.
>
> It provides actionable recommendations:
> - Implement multi-signature governance
> - Encourage wider token distribution
> - Consider JFSA registration if offering to Japanese users
>
> Each violation links directly to the relevant Japanese regulation."

## 🎁 UNIQUE VALUE (2:10-2:30)

**[Visual: Split screen - traditional compliance vs AI agent]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Traditional compliance checks take hours and require legal experts.
>
> Solana Compliance Guardian does it in seconds, autonomously.
>
> It's the only hackathon project combining Solana-native blockchain analysis with Japan's crypto regulations.
>
> Built entirely by AI agents during this hackathon. Every line of code. Every integration. Autonomous."
